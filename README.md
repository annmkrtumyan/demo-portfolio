# Anna — GSAP + Tailwind + (Swup) Demos

Four small, self‑contained demos you can upload anywhere (Netlify Drop, GitHub Pages) or open locally.
All use CDN scripts so no build step is required. Tailwind is loaded via the official CDN.

## Demos
1) **demo1-hero-parallax** — ScrollTrigger parallax hero with reduced‑motion support.
2) **demo2-section-transitions** — Pinned sections, snap scrolling, 60fps-friendly transforms.
3) **demo3-ui-microinteractions** — Buttons/cards micro‑interactions, accessible focus/keyboard states.
4) **demo4-swup-page-transition** — Two-page site using Swup + GSAP overlay transitions.

## Quick Share (fastest)
- Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop and drag the whole `anna-gsap-demos.zip` or any demo folder.
- Or open each `index.html` directly and record a short Loom/video.

## Notes
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` (users with motion sensitivity get instant states).
- All animations rely on transform/opacity for better performance and Core Web Vitals.
